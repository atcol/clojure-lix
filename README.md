.h1 clojure-lix
An implementation of the LIX readability measure written in Clojure

.h3 Why?
Purely to learn functional programming idioms and to practice structuring a Clojure program properly. Furthermore, 
I wanted to "embed" the staple functions that one uses when writing in Clojure.

.h3 Ever heard of regex?
Yes and that would defeat the point of writing this in the first place!
