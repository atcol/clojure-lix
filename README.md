# clojure-lix

An implementation of the LIX readability measure written in Clojure

## Why?

Purely to learn functional programming idioms and to practice structuring a Clojure program properly. Furthermore, 
I wanted to "embed" the staple functions that one uses when writing in Clojure.

## Ever heard of regex?

Yes and that would defeat the point of writing this in the first place!
